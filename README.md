# Dealora

Give Dealora a revenue goal. It finds the opportunity, builds the workflow, and helps move it to a deal.

**DEALORA is an AI Revenue Operating System.** It turns a business revenue goal
into an evidence-backed, permission-controlled, measurable and continuously
optimized revenue workflow:

```
Business → Revenue Goal → ICP → Target Accounts → Research → Evidence →
Qualification → Prioritization → Personalization → Human Approval →
Approved Action → Response → Meeting → Opportunity → Revenue → Learning
```

DEALORA is not a chatbot, a CRM, an email writer, or a lead scraper. It is the
intelligence and execution layer around the revenue stack.

## Repository status

The repository is in **Phase 0 — Repository & Engineering Foundation**
(see [`ROADMAP.md`](./ROADMAP.md)). Application phases (auth, workspace,
Business Brain, revenue loop) are intentionally not started until the Phase 0
gate is met.

Prerequisites: [Bun](https://bun.sh) ≥ 1.1 and Node.js ≥ 22.

```sh
bun install        # install workspace dependencies
bun run check      # run every quality gate (lint, format, typecheck, test, build)
```

| `bun run format:check`  | Prettier verification                    |
| `bun run typecheck`     | Strict TypeScript project-reference check |
| `bun run test`          | Vitest test suite                        |
| `bun run build`         | Build all packages (`tsc -b`)            |
| `bun run check`         | All gates, in CI order (`scripts/verify.sh`) |
